# komputa

Building a full computer including Operating System and one High-Level Language implementation from NAND Gates only.

## Process

Using a generic Hardware Description Language for all chips and gates.

## Structure

* `./hardware/basics` - contains basic Gates, like `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `Xor` and a set of Multiplexers and Demultiplexers. Not optimized for performance yet. Also 4-way, 8-way and 16 bit variants.
* `./hardware/advanced` - contains all the higher level chips to create a simple ALU, which covers the following operations:

```
/**
 * This ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).
 * computes following functions:
 * x+y, x-y, y-x, 0, 1, -1, x, y, -x, -y, !x, !y,
 * x+1, y+1, x-1, y-1, x&y, x|y on two 16-bit inputs, 
 * according to 6 input bits denoted zx,nx,zy,ny,f,no.
 * In addition, the ALU computes two 1-bit outputs:
 * if the ALU output == 0, zr is set to 1; otherwise zr is set to 0;
 * if the ALU output < 0, ng is set to 1; otherwise ng is set to 0.

## Why?

Because I recently climbed up the ladder of abstraction in the other direction: 1 to many computers -- that is, Cloud Stack (Rancher, Kubernetes, Ansible, Helm, you name it..), and wanted to go the other way now: From high-level languages down to 0V and 5V currents.

This is all based upon Nisan and Schocken's excellent "The Elements of Computer Science".
